## Key Improvements Summary

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Dark theme | Light theme |
| Hardcoded localhost URLs | Dynamic production URLs |
| Basic risk info | Detailed metrics + exceeded by |
| No explanation | "What This Means" section |
| Fixed font colors | Professional color scheme |
| No management links | Footer with manage/unsubscribe links |

## Environment Detection

The email automatically detects if you're in production:
```python
is_production = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production"
site_url = "https://safefi.live" if is_production else "http://localhost:5173"
```

So emails will:
- Use `https://safefi.live` when deployed to production
- Use `http://localhost:5173` when running locally

No configuration needed! ðŸŽ‰
