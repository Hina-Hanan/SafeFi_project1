# ML Risk Scoring System - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This guide will help you quickly set up and test the ML Risk Scoring System.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.11+ with virtual environment
- PostgreSQL running with DeFi protocol data

## Step 1: Start the Services

```bash
# Start MLflow server and database
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

Expected output:
```
NAME                        COMMAND                  STATUS              PORTS
main-project-api-1         "uvicorn app.main:apâ€¦"   Up                  0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
main-project-db-1          "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   Up                  0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp  
main-project-mlflow-1      "mlflow server --hosâ€¦"   Up                  0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp
```

## Step 2: Verify MLflow UI

Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

You should see the MLflow tracking UI with:
- Default experiment
- Empty runs (initially)

## Step 3: Test the ML System

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd backend
python test_ml_system.py
```

Expected output:
```

```

## Step 4: Explore the API

### Train Models

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Get Model Performance

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/models/performance
```

### Calculate Risk for a Protocol

First, get a protocol ID:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/protocols | jq '.data[0].protocol.id'
```

Then get risk details:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/risk/protocols/YOUR_PROTOCOL_ID/risk-details
```

### Batch Risk Calculation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/risk/calculate-batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## Step 5: View Results in MLflow

1. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
2. Click on the "risk_scoring" experiment
3. View training runs and metrics
4. Check the Models tab for registered models

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/models/train` | POST | Train ML models with hyperparameter tuning |
| `/models/performance` | GET | Get model performance metrics |
| `/models/compare/{model_name}` | GET | Compare model versions |
| `/risk/protocols/{id}/risk-details` | GET | Detailed risk analysis |
| `/risk/calculate-batch` | POST | Batch risk calculation |
| `/risk/protocols/{id}/history` | GET | Historical risk scores |

## Key Features Implemented

âœ… **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 12+ risk indicators including volatility, liquidity, and stability metrics

âœ… **Multiple ML Algorithms**: RandomForest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning

âœ… **MLflow Integration**: Complete experiment tracking, model registry, and versioning

âœ… **Production-Ready API**: Comprehensive endpoints with proper error handling and validation

âœ… **Real-time Predictions**: Individual protocol risk assessment with confidence scores

âœ… **Batch Processing**: Efficient risk calculation for all protocols with performance monitoring

âœ… **Model Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics, comparison, and trend analysis

âœ… **Explainable AI**: Feature importance and human-readable risk explanations

## Troubleshooting

### If tests fail:

1. **Database Issues**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. **MLflow Issues**: Check if MLflow server is running on port 5000
3. **API Issues**: Verify the FastAPI server is running on port 8000
4. **Dependencies**: Make sure all packages are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Check logs:

```bash
# API logs
docker-compose logs api

# MLflow logs  
docker-compose logs mlflow

# Database logs
docker-compose logs db
```

## Next Steps

1. **Collect Real Data**: Use the data collection service to gather actual protocol metrics
2. **Train on Real Data**: Run model training with production data
3. **Monitor Performance**: Set up regular model retraining and performance monitoring
4. **Integrate with Frontend**: Connect the risk scores to your dashboard
5. **Set up Alerts**: Configure risk threshold alerts for protocols

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Use environment-specific configuration
2. Set up proper logging and monitoring
3. Configure database connection pooling
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
5. Set up automated model retraining schedules
6. Configure proper security and authentication

ðŸŽ¯ **The ML Risk Scoring System is now fully operational!**

You have a production-ready ML pipeline that can:
- Automatically engineer risk features from protocol metrics
- Train and compare multiple ML models
- Generate real-time risk predictions with explanations
- Track all experiments and models in MLflow
- Provide comprehensive API access to all functionality

The system is designed to scale and can be extended with additional features like real-time monitoring, advanced explainability, and automated model deployment.
