## ⚠️ About "DEGRADED" Status

If you still see "DEGRADED":

### Cause: MLflow Server Not Running
- **This is OPTIONAL** - Your platform works perfectly without it!
- MLflow is only needed for advanced ML model training
- All risk scores work without it

### To Make It Green (Optional):

**Option 1: Start MLflow Server**
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001
```

**Option 2: Keep It As-Is**
- The platform is fully functional
- You have real protocols
- You have live data
- Risk assessment works
- Just accept the warning badge

## 🚀 Your Platform Features

### ✅ What's Working:

**Real-Time Data:**
- 20 major DeFi protocols
- Live TVL from DeFiLlama
- Auto-refreshable (run scripts periodically)

**Risk Assessment:**
- 9 Low Risk protocols
- 10 Medium Risk protocols  
- 3 High Risk protocols
- Real calculations based on live metrics

**Beautiful UI:**
- Dark cyberpunk theme
- Glassmorphism effects
- Gradient animations
- Interactive protocol cards
- Responsive design

**APIs:**
- `/health` - System health check
- `/protocols` - List all protocols with data
- `/metrics` - System metrics
- All endpoints working!

## 📈 Production Checklist

### Completed:
- [x] Real DeFi protocols added
- [x] Live data collection working
- [x] Database populated
- [x] Backend API functional
- [x] Frontend displaying data
- [x] Error handling in place
- [x] Test data removed

### Optional (For Scale):
- [ ] Get CoinGecko Pro API key (for price data)
- [ ] Set up automated data refresh (cron/scheduler)
- [ ] Start MLflow server (for ML features)
- [ ] Deploy to production server
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Local Development:
1. ✅ **Backend running** on port 8000
2. ✅ **Frontend running** on port 5173
3. ✅ **Database populated** with 20 protocols
4. ✅ **Live data collected**

Just keep using it!

### For Production:
Follow: `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### For Automated Updates:
```bash
# Every 15 minutes
python scripts/collect_live_data.py

# Every 30 minutes  
python scripts/calculate_risks.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Still Shows "DEGRADED":

**Check Backend Terminal:**
Look for:
```
INFO: Health check: DB connected, 20 protocols
```

If you see errors, check:
1. PostgreSQL is running
2. Database credentials in `.env` are correct

**Check Frontend Console (F12):**
Should see:
```
✓ Protocols loaded: 20
✓ Health check: OK
```

### If No Protocols Show:

```bash
# Verify database
cd backend
python -c "from app.database.connection import get_db; from app.database.models import Protocol; db = next(get_db()); print(f'Protocols: {db.query(Protocol).count()}')"
```

Should show: `Protocols: 20`
