## 🔥 Example AI Questions You Can Ask

After deployment, try these in the AI Assistant:

### General Queries:
- "What are all the monitored protocols?"
- "Show me the highest risk protocols"
- "What's the average risk score?"
- "How many protocols are in the database?"

### Specific Protocol:
- "Tell me about Aave"
- "What's Aave's risk score?"
- "Show me Compound's metrics"
- "Is Uniswap high risk?"

### Risk Analysis:
- "What factors contribute to protocol risk?"
- "Explain the risk scoring model"
- "Why is [protocol] high risk?"
- "What makes a protocol safe?"

### Metrics:
- "Which protocols have the highest TVL?"
- "Show me protocols with TVL above $1B"
- "What's the total value locked across all protocols?"
- "Which protocol has the most volume?"
